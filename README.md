# Form Attendance
**`ðŸ”´ NO LONGER IN USE`**

Form Attendance was an app script project I made during 2019-2020 COVID pandemic for my father ( teacher ) and my school. With just two files of very minimal code , **form_attendance** could create new homeworks in the form of **Google forms** and track their progress by a **Google sheet** . Whenever a valid submission was made by a listed student , the main sheet would update to show that the student submitted their homework. The sheet was responsive to addition of new homework , and would expand its columns as needed.

## STACK USED :
- Google Script
- App Script API
